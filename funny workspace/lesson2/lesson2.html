            <h1>Welcome to my Wiki!</h1>

            <h2>Quarantine Activities</h2>

            <p> 
                One thing you should do is wash your hands. I dont like messy hands, execpt for  when they are paint covered.

            </p>

            <p> 
                I like practicing ukulele during lockdown.
                I've gotten a lot better too.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another thing you can practice during quarantine is yoga.
                You may need a mat though.
            </p>

            <h2>Social Distancing & Friends</h2>

            <p>
                For me I like going onto Zoom calls with my friends and goofing off.
            
            </p> 

            <p>
                Many people like hanging out with their friends outside, but for right now you should stay inside and talk virtually.
            </p>

            <p>
                A lot of my friends reach out to me <strong> A LOT</strong>, because they want to hang out. I dont really feel like that as much, but I'm patient.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>When you're in stores, please be courteous and hygienic.</strong>
            </p>

            <p> 
                I think it's <em>very</em> important to leave enough supplies for everyone
            </p>

            <p>
                To talk to my friends, they go to the park next door, text me to go in my yard,
                and then I make them stand 6 feet away from my fence.
            </p>

                One day, I woke up and got a code from my friends for a video chat. I hopped on and saw everyone's backgrounds.
                The backgrounds I saw were <em>amazing</em>. One was a <b>very</b> fat Winnie the Pooh, another was a funny Trump poster, and the last
                was a coronavirus joke.
