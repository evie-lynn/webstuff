        Part 1: Wash Your Hands!
    </h2>

    <p>
        When interacting with a sick person you could get the germs of whatever sickness they have. <br>
        This means you could be at risk for getting the sickness. But, if you wash your hands, <br>
        then your chance of getting the sickness drops tremendously.

        Part 2: Wash Your Hands Properly
    </h2>

    <p>
        When washing your hands hum, sing, or imagine the song twinkle twinkle little star twice.<br>
        Make sure you scrub in between your fingers, your wrists, and your thumbs.

    </h2>

    <p>
        Alright, let's say your friend has a cold and you high fived them. <br>
        Now, you have the cold germs on your hands. If you were to bite your nails or rub your eyes, <br>
        then you would most likely catch the same cold.

    <h2>Part 4: Germs Are Great Travelers</h2>

    <p>
        Germs are excellent travellers because they are so small they are hard to aviod.<br>
        They pack their bags and go from person to person, making more and more germs.
